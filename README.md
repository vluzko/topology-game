# topology-game

Rules:
1. Run `topology_game.py`. It will give you two topological properties A and B.
2. Prove one of:
    - A -> B
    - A -> not B
    - None of the above, and give counterexamples
3. When you are finished, enter `next` (or anything but `q`) to generate a property C.
4. Check C against A and B
5. And so on
6. Enter `q` to quit.
